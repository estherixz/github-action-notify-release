# github-action-notify-release

GitHub Action that automatically creates an issue with an overview of the commits that are waiting to be released. After a new release is published, the issue will be automatically closed.

## Permissions

This action requires the following permissions:
  - `issues: write`
  - `contents: read`

üí° `contents:read` is required because the action is using a `actions/checkout@v3` action to download the repository content.

## Usage

Configure this action in your workflows providing the inputs described below in order to get notified in `x` time after the repo has been updated but no release has happened.
It is possible to snooze the notification issue for `x` time by closing it as **not planned**. Once the time has passed a new issue will be created.

## Inputs

| inputs                   | required | default               | description |

| `stale-days`             | no       | `7`                   | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecated** Number of days of inactivity before a release becomes stale. The value can be a number or a string. |
| `commit-messages-lines:` | no       | `1`                   | Limit the number of first `x` lines from commit messages that will be added in the issue description. No truncation when set to `0`. |
